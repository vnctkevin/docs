  # Configure Webhook URLs

To configure URLs for webhook notifications, follow these steps in the Fireblocks Console:

1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **General**, then scroll down to the **Configure Webhook URL** heading and select **Manage URLs**.
2.  In the **Configure Webhook URL** window, enter a URL to define the HTTPS endpoint, then press **Enter**.
3.  Select **Save**

Webhook URL requirement

Each webhook URL must be a complete, globally available HTTPS address (e.g., <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">https://example.com</code>).

Once your Webhook is connected to your Fireblocks workspace, you will start receiving notifications on events in that workspace.
