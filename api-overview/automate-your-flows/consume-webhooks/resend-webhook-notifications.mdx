  # Resend Webhook Notifications

Fireblocks customers can resend webhook notifications that were missed by their server by using the following API endpoints:

*   [Resend failed webhooks](/reference/resendwebhooks) - Resends all failed webhook notifications
*   [Resend webhooks for a transaction by ID](/reference/resendtransactionwebhooks) - Resends webhook notifications for a transaction by its unique identifier

  

* * *

# [Resend all failed webhook notifications](#resend-all-failed-webhook-notifications)

The following command re-sends **all** the failed webhooks pending the backoff retry mechanism being re-sent.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript

const result = await fireblocks.resendWebhooks();


```

```python

result = fireblocks.resend_webhooks()


```
</CodeGroup>

*   The above command returns `webhookCount` which is the number of re-sent webhook notifications.

* * *

# [Resend missed notifications for a specific transaction](#resend-missed-notifications-for-a-specific-transaction)

Use the following command to re-send a missing webhook notification per specific transaction:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript

const result = await fireblocks.resendTransactionWebhooksById(txId, resendCreated, resendStatusUpdated);


```

```python

result = fireblocks.resend_transaction_webhooks_by_id(txId, resend_created, resend_status_updated)


```
</CodeGroup>

> Returns 200 on success
