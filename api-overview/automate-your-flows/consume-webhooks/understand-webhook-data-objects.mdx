  # Understand Webhook Data Objects

The data objects sent in webhook events are identical to those consumed via the API. This consistency ensures that the information you receive through webhooks can be seamlessly integrated with your existing API workflows, providing a unified approach to handling data across your Fireblocks environment.

All Fireblocks webhooks follow the same object structure:

*   **type** - This is a fixed value that describes each specific webhook.
*   **tenantId** - The unique ID of your Fireblocks workspace.
*   **timestamp** - The timestamp of the event in milliseconds.
*   **data** - This is an object containing information that relates to each specific webhook type.

You can find all the Webhook event types and their data objects descriptions under the [**Errors & Data Objects** -> **Webhook** section](/reference/webhooks-notifications-1)
