New Callback Handler parameters

Beginning with API Co-Signer image 3.5.0, we made the following enhancements:

*   The Callback Handler can now return the new `RETRY` action. Learn more below.
*   When using API Co-Signers in a high availability configuration, the Callback Handler payload includes the **signerId** that will have the **API user id** value of the **API user handling the request**. The Callback Handler can use this parameter to identify which of the high availability servers made the request.

Learn more about updating your API Co-Signer [here](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/4581893798940-Updating-the-API-Co-Signer).

</Info>

Below is the response expected from the Callback Handler for any request. If it does not respond within 30 seconds, Fireblocks fails the request.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| action | string | `APPROVE`: Approves the request. For some configuration requests, a quorum may be required to approve the request.  
  
`REJECT`: Denies the request. Even if a quorum of approvals is expected, one rejection denies the request.  
  
`RETRY`: Retry the request until it times out, reaches the maximum number of retries, or the Callback Handler returns `APPROVE` or `REJECT`. Note that the timeout setting is fixed to 20 retries every 3 minutes, for a total of 60 minutes. There are future plans to introduce the option to configure the timeout at the tenant level. Additionally, retries are performed using identical parameters, so to prevent duplication, make sure your Callback Handler is properly configured to deal with the asynchronous nature of the calls.  
  
`IGNORE`: This action is only supported for transaction and configuration approvals, not transaction signing. Dismisses the request without denying it, allowing the following approval requests to be processed. If a quorum is required to approve a request, the other approvers may approve this request independently. |
| requestId | string | The unique identifier of the call, as received in the approval request. |
| rejectionReason | string | (Optional) Free text of the reason for rejection. This is used for logging purposes and recorded in the workspace's audit logs. |
