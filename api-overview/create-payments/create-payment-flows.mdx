  # Create Payment Flows

# [What are Payment Flows?](#what-are-payment-flows)

Fireblocks empowers you to leverage blockchains and digital rails for efficient, dependable, and predictable payments. The Payments feature in Fireblocks enables the creation of secure, dynamic payment flows that consist of various actions within a single solution.

Payment flows allow you to streamline and automate your payment transactions. By configuring and executing payments directly from the Payments page in the Fireblocks Console or via the [Fireblocks API](/reference/createflowconfiguration) , you can manage various types of financial operations with ease and precision.
