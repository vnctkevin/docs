# [Creating a payout instruction set](#creating-a-payout-instruction-set)

When a user wants to send a payment to one or more of their merchants, they can use the Payout Service API to send the payout from their exchange account.

First, the user creates a payout instruction set using the [Create a payout instruction set](/reference/post_payments-payout) API call. The instruction set defines:

*   the payment account and its account type (vault, exchange, or fiat).
*   the account type (vault account, exchange account, whitelisted address, network connection, fiat account, or merchant account), the amount, and the asset of payment for each payee account.

In this example, the user wants to send funds from an exchange account (id: ‚ÄúEX\_SUB3‚Äù) in their Fireblocks workspace. They want to send 43 USDC to Merchant 1 (id: ‚Äúbef85a1c-b605-4b2e-bdb5-2d400f4d0bf3‚Äù) who is configured as an external wallet and 4,423 USDC to Merchant 2 (id: ‚Äú3adc1f92-e791-44a8-9aee-7f31c2108b78‚Äù) who is configured as a Fireblocks Network connection.

  },
  "instructionSet": [
    {
      "payeeAccount": {

        "assetId": "USDC"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
</CodeGroup>## [Response](#response)

The user then receives a unique payoutId ("1fe3b61f-7e1f-4a19-aff0-4f0a524d44d7") for their payout instruction set. This payoutId can then be used for executing the payout.

The response body also lists the state of the payout instruction set as REQUESTED and the two payment states as NOT\_STARTED.
