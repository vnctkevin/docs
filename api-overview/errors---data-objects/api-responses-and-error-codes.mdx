# [API Error Codes](#api-error-codes)

The table below contains all error codes (and their related HTTP status codes) for the Fireblocks API. We recommend reviewing the codes related to the features you want to implement for your workspace and customers.

## [4XX Error Codes](#4xx-error-codes)

| Error Code | HTTP Status Code | Relevant Features | Issue and Remediation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| \-1 | 401 | All | **Invalid signature**  
If you receive this error message, ensure the private key you used is correct. |
| \-2 | 401 | All | **Missing API Key in the JWT**  
Verify that you specify the API key |
| \-3 | 401 | All | **The entire JWT is missing**  
_Uncommon_ - Potential code change, or bad parameters passed to Fireblocks SDK constructor |
| \-4 | 401 | All | **Wrong URL in the JWT**  
_Uncommon_ - Potential code change to the Fireblocks SDK source code on your device |
| \-5 | 401 | All | **Unauthorized: Invalid token format**  
This error code typically indicates the certificate associated with the API user making the call has expired. |
| \-6 | 401 | All | **Wrong User in the JWT**  
The user that is being used as part of the request is incorrect, verify that the correct user is being used |
| \-7 | 401 | All | **Unauthorized: Token was not accepted**  
This error code typically indicates the JSON Web Token (JWT) supplied with the API user’s request was not accepted. API requests to Fireblocks are authenticated using the provided JWT. If the JWT is invalid, you will receive the error code. The cause of the error is likely either the wrong API key being used or the wrong baseURL being used.  
  
For SDK users, this typically means an incorrect API key was used to create the client. For users with native API client implementations, this typically indicates an error with your JWT creation logic. |
| \-8 | 401 | All | **Insufficient permissions**  
This error code typically indicates the API user initiating this request does not have access to the requested operation based on their user role |
| \-10 | 401 | All | **The request has expired**  
This error typically indicates the JSON Web Token (JWT) supplied with the API user’s request has timed out.  
  
Please note:  
  
\- For Fireblocks SDK users, the JWT expiration time is defined based on the system time.  
\- For users with their own API client implementations, the JWT data is defined by the user’s implementation. |
| \-12 | 401 | All | **The request is with a future issuance timestamp (iat)**  
This error code typically indicates the JSON Web Token (JWT) supplied with the API user’s request is not yet valid for processing.  
  
\- For SDK users, the JWT “initiated–at” time is defined based on the system time.  
\- For users with their own API client implementations, the JWT data is defined by the user’s implementation. |
