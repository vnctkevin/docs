  # Raw Signing Objects

## [RawMessageData](#rawmessagedata)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| messages | array of [UnsignedRawMessage](#unsignedrawmessage) objects | The messages that should be signed |
| algorithm | string | \[optional\] The algorithm which will be used to sign the transaction, one of the [SigningAlgorithms](/reference/vault-objects#signingalgorithm) |

* * *

## [SignedMessage](#signedmessage)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| content | string | The message for signing (hex-formatted) |
| algorithm | string | The algorithm that was used for signing, one of the [SigningAlgorithms](/reference/vault-objects#signingalgorithm) |
| derivationPath | Array of numbers | [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) derivation path of the signing key. E.g. \[44,0,46,0,0\] |
| signature | dictionary | The message signature |
| publicKey | string | The signature's public key is used for verification. |

* * *

## [UnsignedRawMessage](#unsignedrawmessage)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| content | string | The message to be signed in hex format encoding |
| bip44AddressIndex | number | \[optional\] [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) address\_index path level |
| bip44change | number | \[optional\] [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) change path level |
|  | The 2 fields above complement the derivation path given the source id and asset were provided in the transaction body request. |  |
|  | In case none of the above was provided, please specify the derivation path. |  |
| derivationPath | array of numbers | \[optional\] Should be passed only if asset and source were not specified |
| type | string | \[optional\] Should be passed only if `operation` is `TYPED_MESSAGE`. Possible values are:  
  
\- `EIP191`: for ETH/EVM personal messages  
\- `EIP712`: For ETH/EVM typed messages  
\- `TIP191`: For TRX personal messages  
\- `BTC_MESSAGE`: For BTC personal messages |
| preHash | [PreHash object](/reference/raw-signing-objects#prehash) | An object to send when creating ECDSA Raw signing requests. |

  
## [PreHash](#prehash)

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| content | string | The pre-hashed content in hexadecimal representation. |
| hashAlgorithm | string | The hashing algorithm to apply to the provided content.  
Possible values:  
  
\- SHA256  
\- KECCAK256  
\- BLAKE2  
\- SHA3
