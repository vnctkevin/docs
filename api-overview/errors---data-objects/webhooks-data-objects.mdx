  # Webhooks Data Objects

# [Overview](#overview)

Webhooks allow you to receive notifications for events that happen in your Fireblocks workspace. [Learn more about configuring and validating webhooks](/docs/configure-webhooks).

All Fireblocks webhooks follow the same object structure:

*   **type** - This is a fixed value that describes each specific webhook.
*   **tenantId** - The unique ID of your Fireblocks workspace.
*   **timestamp** - The timestamp of the event in milliseconds.
*   **data** - This is an object containing information that relates to each specific webhook type.
