### [TransactionOperation](#transactionoperation)

| --- | --- | --- |
| operation | string | \[`TRANSFER`, `MINT`, `BURN`, `CONTRACT_CALL`, `TYPED_MESSAGE`, `RAW`, `ENABLE_ASSET`, `STAKE`, `UNSTAKE`, `WITHDRAW`\]  
Not all operations are available in all workspaces. Contact your account manager to enable additional features.  
  
`TRANSFER` - Default. Transfers funds from one account to another. UTXO blockchains allow multi-input and multi-output transfers. All other blockchains allow transfers with one source address and one destination address.  
  
`MINT` - Mints new tokens. Supported for Stellar, Ripple, and EVM-based blockchains. [Learn more about tokenization on Fireblocks](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/4725474481308).  
  
`BURN` - Burns tokens. Supported for Stellar, Ripple, and EVM-based blockchains. [Learn more about tokenization on Fireblocks](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/4725474481308).  
  
`CONTRACT_CALL` - Calls a smart contract method for web3 operations on any EVM blockchain. The [Fireblocks development libraries](/docs/ethereum-development#convenience-libraries) are recommended for building contract call transactions.  
  
`TYPED_MESSAGE` - An off-chain message in either Ethereum Personal Message or EIP712 format. Use it to sign specific readable messages that are not actual transactions. [Learn more about typed messages](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413379762450-Off-chain-message-signing#h_01FQXY26HB87NZJFRT77B1KY6Z).  
  
`RAW` - An off-chain message with no predefined format. Use it to sign any message with your private key, including protocols such as blockchains and custom transaction types that are not natively supported by Fireblocks. [Learn more about raw signing transactions](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413379762450-Off-chain-message-signing).  
  
`ENABLE_ASSET` - Algorand, DigitalBits, Solana, and Stellar require an on-chain transaction to create an asset wallet and enable the deposit address. This transaction is automatically created when adding assets on these blockchains to a vault account.  
  
`STAKE` - Assign assets to a staking pool managed by a staking validator. [Learn more about staking transactions and supported blockchains](/docs/staking#managing-staking-transactions). This transaction is automatically created when performing staking operations.  
  
`UNSTAKE` - Remove assets from a staking pool managed by a staking validator. [Learn more about staking transactions and supported blockchains](/docs/staking#managing-staking-transactions).This transaction is automatically created when performing staking operations.  
  
`WITHDRAW` - Transfer assets from a dedicated staking vault account to another address. [Learn more about staking transactions and supported blockchains](/docs/staking#managing-staking-transactions).This transaction is automatically created when performing staking operations.  
**Note:** Fireblocks may rename this type from WITHDRAW to a different name soon. There will be at minimum a 7-day notice regarding the new type name. |
