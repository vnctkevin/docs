  # List network connections

get https://api.fireblocks.io/v1/network\_connections

Returns all network connections.

**Note:** This API call is subject to Flexible Routing Schemes.

Your routing policy defines how your transactions are routed.  
You can choose 1 of the 3 different schemes mentioned below for each asset type:

*   **None**; Defines the profile routing to no destination for that asset type. Incoming transactions to asset types routed to `None` will fail.
*   **Custom**; Route to an account that you choose. If you remove the account, incoming transactions will fail until you choose another one.
*   **Default**; Use the routing specified by the network profile the connection is connected to. This scheme is also referred to as "Profile Routing"

Default Workspace Presets:

*   Network Profile Crypto → **Custom**
    
*   Network Profile FIAT → **None**
    
*   Network Connection Crypto → **Default**
    
*   Network Connection FIAT → **Default**
    
    *   **Note**: By default, Custom routing scheme uses (`dstId` = `0`, `dstType` = `VAULT`).
