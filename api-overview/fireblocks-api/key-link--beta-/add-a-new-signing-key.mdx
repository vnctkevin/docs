  # Add a new signing key

post https://api.fireblocks.io/v1/key\_link/signing\_keys

Adds a new signing key to the workspace. The added key will be linked to the specific Fireblocks agent user ID. The same user will receive the proof of ownership message to be signed, and upon successful proof, the key will become enabled.  
Please note that this endpoint is available only for Key Link enabled workspaces.  
**Note:**  
This endpoint is currently in beta and might be subject to changes.
