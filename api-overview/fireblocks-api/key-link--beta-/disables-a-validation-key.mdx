  # Disables a validation key

patch https://api.fireblocks.io/v1/key\_link/validation\_keys/{keyId}

Allows disabling validation key even if it has not expired yet. It is not allowed to enable the validation key back. Another key has to be used for future validations.  
Please note that this endpoint is available only for Key Link enabled workspaces.  
**Note:**  
This endpoint is currently in beta and might be subject to changes.
