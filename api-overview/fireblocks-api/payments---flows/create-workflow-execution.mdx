Validate the "workflow-config" previously created by utilizing the unique "configId". This step requires the mandatory field amount, and allows for modifications to other fields defined via the "workflow-config" endpoint, including pre-screening preferences. A response containing the "workflowExecutionId" and detailing the validation status will be provided. Execution is ready when the "workflow-execution" status is READY\_FOR\_LAUNCH, at which point it can be initiated with "POST /workflow-execution/{workflowExecutionId}/actions/execute".
