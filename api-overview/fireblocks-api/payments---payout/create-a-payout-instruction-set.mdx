**Create a payout instruction set.**  
  
A payout instruction set is a set of instructions for distributing payments from a single payment account to a list of payee accounts.  
  
The instruction set defines:  

*   the payment account and its account type (vault, exchange, or fiat).
*   the account type (vault account, exchange account, whitelisted address, network connection, fiat account, or merchant account), the amount, and the asset of payment for each payee account.
