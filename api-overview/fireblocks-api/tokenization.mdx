  # Issue a new token

post https://api.fireblocks.io/v1/tokenization/tokens

Facilitates the creation of a new token, supporting both EVM-based and Stellar/Ripple platforms. For EVM, it deploys the corresponding contract template to the blockchain and links the token to the workspace. For Stellar/Ripple, it links a newly created token directly to the workspace without deploying a contract. Returns the token link with status "PENDING" until the token is deployed or "SUCCESS" if no deployment is needed.
