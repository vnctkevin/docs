  # Freeze

post https://api.fireblocks.io/v1/workspace/freeze

Freezes a Workspace so that ALL operations by ANY user are blocked.

You should only perform this action when the workspace faces imminent risk,  
such as when you have a security breach.

To unfreeze a workspace, the workspace Owner must submit a request to  
Fireblocks Support.

**NOTE:**

*   This operation can only be performed by the workspace Admins
    
*   Your workspace continues to receive incoming transfers during this time.
