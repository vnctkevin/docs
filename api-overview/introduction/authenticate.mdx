  # Authenticate

## [Signing a request](#signing-a-request)

Fireblocks uses API keys to authenticate all API calls. Depending on the type of workspace environment, the **base API URL** will be one of the following:

*   Sandbox: `https://sandbox-api.fireblocks.io/v1`
*   Mainnet/Testnet: `https://api.fireblocks.io/v1`

Every API request must contain the following headers:

*   `X-API-Key` - The API Key created from your Fireblocks workspace.
*   `Authorization` - This value should be set to `Bearer <Access Token>`. The access token is a Base64-encoded JSON Web Token (JWT).

  
## [JWT Structure](#jwt-structure)

<button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">Authorization: Bearer &lt;JWT&gt;</code>

The JWT payload field should contain the following fields:

*   `uri` - The URI part of the request (e.g., /v1/transactions).
*   `nonce` - Unique number or string. Each API request needs to have a different nonce.
*   `iat` - The time at which the JWT was issued, in seconds since Epoch.
*   `exp` - The expiration time on and after which the JWT must not be accepted for processing, in seconds since Epoch. (Must be less than `iat`+30sec.)
*   `sub` - The API Key.
*   `bodyHash` - Hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the raw HTTP request body.

The JWT must be signed with the Fireblocks API secret key and the RS256 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 using SHA-256 hash) algorithm.

## [Using the Fireblocks SDKs](#using-the-fireblocks-sdks)

You can setup the request headers using the [Fireblocks API SDKs](/docs/api-sdk-overview), like so:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import {FireblocksSDK, PeerType, TransactionArguments, TransactionOperation, TransactionStatus} from "fireblocks-sdk";

apiSecret = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "./fireblocks_secret.key"), "utf8");
const apiKey = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX";
fireblocks = new FireblocksSDK(apiSecret, apiKey);

```

```python
from fireblocks_sdk import FireblocksSDK, TransferPeerPath, DestinationTransferPeerPath, TRANSACTION_STATUS_CONFIRMED, TRANSACTION_STATUS_CANCELLED, TRANSACTION_STATUS_REJECTED, TRANSACTION_STATUS_FAILED, VAULT_ACCOUNT, TRANSACTION_MINT, TRANSACTION_BURN

apiSecret = open('fireblocks_secret.key', 'r').read()
apiKey = 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX'
fireblocks = FireblocksSDK(apiSecret, apiKey)

```

Fireblocks API key

When using the above SDK code examples to sign a request, be sure to replace <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">apiKey</code> with your own API Key.
