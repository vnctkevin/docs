  # Get Supported Assets

# [Overview](#overview)
  

Fireblocks supports hundreds of EVM tokens and dozens of different blockchains. Customers can add their own tokens on different networks as long as these are supported. To learn more, read the [following guide](/reference/add-your-tokens).

Fireblocks provides an API to retrieve information about all supported assets, including their unique Fireblocks ID, symbol, contract address (if applicable), and more. This allows customers to see a comprehensive list of supported assets and integrate them into their operations.

  
## [Listing Supported Assets](#listing-supported-assets)

To list all supported assets and their information, customers can utilize the [Get Supported Assets](/reference/getsupportedassets-1) endpoint. This endpoint provides detailed information about each supported asset within the Fireblocks ecosystem.

  
## [Key Points](#key-points)

*   **Global vs. Local Support**: Some assets are supported globally across all Fireblocks workspaces, while others are supported locally for specific workspaces. The level of support depends on the token's popularity among Fireblocks customers.
*   **Comprehensive Information**: The API returns detailed information about each asset, including its unique Fireblocks ID, symbol, contract address, and other relevant details.

By using this endpoint, customers can ensure they have up-to-date information on all supported assets, enabling them to manage their portfolios and transactions more effectively.

  
## [Code Example:](#code-example)
<CodeGroup>
```typescript
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { Fireblocks, BasePath } from "@fireblocks/ts-sdk";

const FIREBLOCKS_API_SECRET_PATH = "<PATH_TO_YOUR_SECRET>";

// Initialize a Fireblocks API instance with local variables
const fireblocks = new Fireblocks({
    apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
    basePath: BasePath.US,
    secretKey: readFileSync(FIREBLOCKS_API_SECRET_PATH, "utf8"),
});


(async() => {

  const supportedAssets = await fireblocks.blockchainsAssets.getSupportedAssets()

  console.log(JSON.stringify(supportedAssets, null, 2))

})();

```

In the response above you can see that some of the returned tokens have different properties depending on the blockchain.<br>Here we have a SPL (Solana) token with the Fireblocks ID <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">YARD_SOL</code> and the mint address under <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">issuerAddress</code> while the second object represents an <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">ERC20</code> token on Ethereum with Fireblocks ID <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">YFI</code> and some additional data like the decimals and the contract's address.
