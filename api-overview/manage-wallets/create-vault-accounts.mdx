  # Create Vault Accounts

Your Fireblocks workspace utilizes a hierarchy of vault accounts as part of its [Object Model](/docs/object-model). This hierarchy allows you to segregate funds belonging to different business units or deposited by different users.

A Vault account can hold multiple assets. To transfer to or from vault accounts, your source or destination targets must be provided with both their vault ID and asset ID.

Use the [Create a new vault account](/reference/createvaultaccount) API call to create a new vault account that will hold your UTXO or account-based wallets.

### [Code Example](#code-example)
<CodeGroup>
```typescript
(async() => {

  const vaultAccount = await fireblocks.vaults.createVaultAccount({
    createVaultAccountRequest: {
      name: "MyVaultAccount",
      autoFuel: true,
      hiddenOnUI: false
    }
  })
  console.log(JSON.stringify(vaultAccount.data, null, 2))

})();

```

```python
vault_account = fireblocks.create_vault_account(
    name="MyVaultAccount",
    hiddenOnUI=False,
    autoFuel=True
)

```
</CodeGroup>### [Response Example](#response-example)
<CodeGroup>
```json
{
  "id": "148",
  "name": "MyVaultAccount",
  "hiddenOnUI": false,
  "assets": [],
  "autoFuel": true
}

```
</CodeGroup>

# [Optional parameters](#optional-parameters)
  
### [hiddenOnUI](#hiddenonui)

Set to <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">true</code> by default, hides this vault account from appearing in the Fireblocks Console.

This is the best practice when creating intermediate deposit vault accounts for your users as it helps reduce visual clutter and improves UI loading time.

The best practice is configuring this setting so that only your omnibus account and another operational vault account (or multiple) are visible in the Fireblocks Console.

### [autoFuel](#autofuel)

If the <span class="GlossaryItem-trigger">Gas Station</span> service is enabled on your workspace, this flag needs to be set to <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">true</code> if you wish to monitor and fuel this account's Ethereum address upon detected balance refresh events, such as when deposits of ERC20 tokens occur.
