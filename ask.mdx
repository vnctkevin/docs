You can ask questions by tagging `@ellipsis-dev`. If Ellipsis can't answer your question, it'll ask for clarification or respond in a confused way.

You can use this feature to:

1.  answering a question about your codebase
2.  creating a pull request
3.  reviewing a pull request
4.  creating a GitHub/Linear ticket
5.  removing all previous reviews by Ellipsis

**Note**: There is no autocomplete for `@ellipsis-dev`
