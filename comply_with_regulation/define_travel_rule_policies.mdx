  # Define Travel Rule Policies

[Suggest Edits](/edit/define-travel-rule-policies)

The [Financial Action Task Force (FATF)](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/) recommended the Travel Rule in order to combat money laundering and terrorist trafficking activity. The rule states that Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which include businesses that exchange virtual assets, must provide additional data on the senders and recipients of certain transactions. Each jurisdiction decides which transactions must adhere to the Travel Rule and what data must be included.

<Warning>

## 🚧

Fireblocks does not permanently store any transaction data needed specifically for the Travel Rule.

All Travel Rule data is encrypted and stored with Notabene if needed. Fireblocks does not hold the keys for decrypting the information.

</Warning>  

To help you comply with the Travel Rule, Fireblocks provides integration with Travel Rule provider [Notabene](https://notabene.id/). Notabene analyzes your incoming and outgoing transactions in real time and screens them based on your workspace’s Travel Rule policy. After Notabene screens a transaction and determines its compliance with the Travel Rule, the appropriate action can be taken automatically.

After integrating Notabene with your Fireblocks workspace, you can configure and manage various settings and policies. In your Notabene dashboard, you can configure settings related to your Notabene account. In your Fireblocks workspace, you can create a Travel Rule policy to determine which transactions should be screened and what post-screening actions should be taken based on the screening status.

[You can read Notabene's documentation for more information on how they integrate with Fireblocks.](https://devx.notabene.id/docs/using-notabene-and-fireblocks)
