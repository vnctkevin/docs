  # Interact with TRUST

[Suggest Edits](/edit/interact-with-trust)

The [Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST)](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/introducing-the-travel-rule-universal-solution-technology-trust) platform can be used to securely send information required by the Travel Rule.

To interact with TRUST from your Fireblocks workspace, you must use an appropriate format of Typed Message Signing when publishing a proof of address on the TRUST internal bulletin. This signing method is safer than (and preferred over) Raw Signing because it helps mitigate the risk of users signing a valid but malicious transaction.
