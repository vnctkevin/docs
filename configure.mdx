# Configure

<Info>

TLDR:

Use an `ellipsis.yaml` file to customize how Ellipsis behaves. This will override any global settings you have configured via the web UI.



</Info>
## [Organization config​](#null)

In the web app at [https://app.ellipsis.dev](https://app.ellipsis.dev), you can configure these default settings across your entire organization:

*   **Automatically review PRs** (default `true`): Should we review pull requests when published and on each new commit?
*   **Automatically summarize PRs** (default `true`): Should we summarize pull requests when published and on each new commit?
*   **Quiet mode** (default `false`): Should Ellipsis skip commenting 'Looks good to me!' when there are no issues found?
*   **Automatically add implementation plans to issues** (default `false`): See [plan](/plan).

## [Repository config​](#null)

Use an `ellipsis.yaml` file in your repository root to customize how Ellipsis behaves. This will override any global settings you have configured via the web UI.

### [Getting Started​](#null)

Here is a small example you can copy/paste. Be sure to update it for your repository!

```
version: 1.3  
  
pr\_review:  
confidence\_threshold: 0.7  
rules:  
\- "Code should be DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself)"  
\- "There should no secrets or credentials in the code"
```

Here's an example of how we configure Ellipsis on our internal repo:

```
version: 1.3  
  
about:  
\- "This is a codebase for a code generation tool called Ellipsis. It can review GitHub pull requests, answer questions about code, and even generate bug fixes!"  
\- "We're migrating away from using AWS CDK. Our infrastructure is no longer part of this repository."  
  
\# See: https://docs.ellipsis.dev/build  
build:  
file: "ellipsis.Dockerfile"  
commands:  
\- name: "lint\_fix"  
description: "Lints the code in fix mode, which will fix some errors, format some files, and throw and error when there are violations."  
command: "./scripts/lint.sh"  
\- name: "unit\_tests"  
description: "Runs the unit tests."  
command: ./scripts/unit\_test.sh  
  
pr\_review:  
confidence\_threshold: 0.7  
rules:  
\- "Code should be DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself)"  
\- "There should no secrets or credentials in the code"  
\- "Extremely Complicated Code Needs Comments"  
\- "Use Descriptive Variable and Constant Names"  
\- "API routes must have error handling, they shouldn't intentionally return a HTTP 500"  
\- "Use retries when calling external API services"  
\- "Don't log sensitive data"  
\- "Follow the Single Responsibility Principle"  
\- "Function and Method Naming Should Follow Consistent Patterns"
```
### [Provide general information about your repo​](#null)

Use the `about` section to give Ellipsis general information and preferences about your repo, especially anything hard for Ellipsis to discover from reading your code:

```
version: 1.3  
  
about:  
\- "We're in the middle of migrating from X to Y, so new components should use Y."  
\- "Everything in \`/foo/bar\` is deprecated."
```
### [Ignore files​](#null)

Use the `ignore` section to list files, directories, or Unix shell-style wildcards (similar to .gitignore) you want Ellipsis to ignore across all workflows.

```
version: 1.3  
  
ignore:  
\- old\_README.md # ignore this file  
\- archive/ # ignore everything in the \`archive/\` directory  
\- data/\*.csv # ignore all .csv files in the \`data/\` directory
```
## [PR reviews​](#null)

You can customize how Ellipsis behaves when reviewing code by modifying the `pr_review` section of your `ellipsis.yaml`. Need help? [Contact us](/contact).

Here's an example of a rule that says "Don't log sensitive data": ![img alt](https://docs.ellipsis.dev/assets/images/pr_review_rules-7727b3a0f8497249e8b1bf1146f64968.png)

### [Custom review rules​](#null)

Rules are natural language instructions for our code review AI.

For example, if you work with Tailwind, you might add a rule like "Always use an object to store Tailwind CSS properties instead of defining them inline". When no rules are provided, we use a set of sensible defaults.

```
pr\_review:  
rules:  
\- "Code should be DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself)"  
\- "There should no secrets or credentials in the code"
```
### [Custom summary rules​](#null)

Similar to review rules, you can add custom rules for your summaries.

```
pr\_review:  
summary\_rules:  
\- "Do not mention anything in the /deprecated directory"
```
### [Improve comment quality​](#null)

Increasing the `confidence_threshold` will result in fewer, but higher quality comments.

```
pr\_review:  
confidence\_threshold: 0.85
```
### [Quiet mode​](#null)

If `quiet` mode is enabled, Ellipsis will only leave reviews when it has comments, so "Looks good to me" reviews will be skipped. This can reduce clutter.

```
pr\_review:  
quiet: true
```
### [Enable/disable automatic reviews​](#null)

You can also disable automatic code review using `auto_review_enabled`.

```
pr\_review:  
auto\_review\_enabled: false
```
### [Enable/disable automatic summaries​](#null)

You can also disable automatic code summaries using `auto_summarize_pr` .

```
pr\_review:  
auto\_summarize\_pr: false
```
### [Auto-review draft PRs​](#null)

You can enable auto-review on draft PRs using `auto_review_draft`.

```
pr\_review:  
auto\_review\_draft: true
```
### [Ignore certain base/head branches​](#null)

You can disable auto-review on particular branches by specifying names (or Unix shell-style wildcards).

```
pr\_review:  
ignore:  
base:  
\- "staging" # ignore PRs into the 'staging' branch  
head:  
\- "test/\*" # ignore PRs on branches starting with 'test/'  
\- "debug/\*" # ignore PRs on branches starting with 'debug/'
```
### [Approve PRs with no issues​](#null)

You can allow Ellipsis to approve PRs using `enable_approve_prs`. Note: in common branch protection configurations, the Ellipsis approval will count towards the approval total and allow the PR to be merged when it otherwise may not be.

```
pr\_review:  
enable\_approve\_prs: true
```
## [Addressing PR comments​](#null)

You can choose how Ellipsis returns code it generates while addressing comments on a PR. Choose between `new_pr` or `new_commit`.

```
version: 1.3  
pr\_address\_comments:  
delivery: "new\_pr"
```
## [User specific behavior​](#null)

You can add personalized configurations for each developer on the team using `user_overrides`, which is at the top level of the config. Use this if you want to try out Ellipsis before enabling it for the rest of the team.

```
pr\_review:  
confidence\_threshold: 0.5  
rules:  
\- "Code should be DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself)"  
\- "There should no secrets or credentials in the code"  
  
user\_overrides:  
\- usernames: \["user1"\]  
rules:  
\- "All new functions should have docstrings."  
\- usernames: \["user2", "user3"\]  
confidence\_threshold: 0.9
```

In this example, `user1` will inherited the `confidence_threshold=0.5`, but will replace the two rules; meanwhile, `user2` and `user3` will retain the two base rules but have their own `confidence_threshold=0.9`

### [Enable Ellipsis for only some users​](#null)

Ellipsis calculates your active users by checking the number of seats vs. the number of users who have triggered a workflow in the last month.

If you want to enable Ellipsis for only some users, you can use the `user_overrides` (see above):

```
pr\_review:  
auto\_summarize\_pr: false  
auto\_review\_enabled: false  
  
user\_overrides:  
\- usernames: \["user1", "user2", "user3"\]  
auto\_summarize\_pr: true  
auto\_review\_enabled: true
```

In this example, `user1`, `user2`, and `user3` will be the only users to automatically get summaries and reviews.
