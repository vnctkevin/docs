Overview

[](#overview)

With the [launch of the new Base L2](https://base.mirror.xyz/jjQnUq_UNTQOk7psnGBFOsShi7FlrRp8xevQUipG_Gk) network by Coinbase we decided to quickly add support to the Fireblocks developer sandbox for developers to be able to experiment with the new L2 testnet using the Fireblocks dev tools.

<Info>

Base Support is only active in Developer Sandbox workspaces

Please note that the Base Goerli integration is only active in the Developer Sandbox. We do not have a clear timeline for support in regular Testnet/Mainnet workspaces.

Getting Started using Web3Provider

[](#getting-started-using-web3provider)

To develop on Base Goerli Testnet using `web3.js` or `ethers.js`:

1.  Follow the instructions in the [Ethereum Development](/docs/ethereum-development) guide
2.  In the Setup section:
    1.  Set `chainId` to `84531`
    2.  Set `assetId` to `'BASECHAIN_ETH_TEST3'`

At the end your `FireblocksWeb3Provider` constructor would look similar to:

<pre><button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">const eip1193Provider = new FireblocksWeb3Provider({
    apiBaseUrl: ApiBaseUrl.Sandbox // If using a sandbox workspace
    privateKey: process.env.FIREBLOCKS_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH,
    apiKey: process.env.FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY,
    vaultAccountIds: process.env.FIREBLOCKS_VAULT_ACCOUNT_IDS,
    chainId: 84531,
    assetId: 'BASECHAIN_ETH_TEST3',
})
</code></pre>

With this you can just interact with BASE Goerli Testnet this like any other EVM chain.

You can also use any other Fireblocks SDK, or other dev tool from the [API/SDK Overview](/docs/api-sdk-overview) using the chainId and assetId mentioned above.

Creating a Base Vault Account

[](#creating-a-base-vault-account)

You can create a base vault account via the API or UI using the proper assetId.

In the API you can follow the instructions in the [Create a new vault account](/reference/post_vault-accounts) using the `BASECHAIN_ETH_TEST3` assetId.

In the UI it's as simple as clicking on "Create Asset" in an account:

Getting Test Assets

[](#getting-test-assets)

There are a few ways to get Base Goerli for experimentation - you can use the bridge on regular Goerli - and if you are at EthDenver building on Fireblocks - let us know - we might be able to help.
