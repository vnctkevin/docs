Installation

Installation takes 1 minute. [Install on GitHub here](https://app.ellipsis.dev), or [install on GitLab (beta) here](https://app.ellipsis.dev/gitlab)



</Info>

*   Ellipsis works in any [GitHub](https://www.github.com) repository or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) project (GitLab support is in beta).
*   No IDE extensions required; we write, build, and test your code in the cloud.
*   Using Ellipsis for code generation works best when you provide a [Dockerfile](/build). Without it, we can't test the code we write!
*   Upon installation, we'll automatically review up to 3 of your most recent, open pull requests.
*   All future pull requests will be automatically reviewed.

We request limited permissions: ![a screenshot of the github permissions required to install Ellipsis, they&#39;re very limited and only include the permissions that is exactly required to review, summarize, and write code onbehalf of github users](https://docs.ellipsis.dev/assets/images/install_permissions-24ba7e39676673316da2de03c52abe29.png)
