# Introduction

<Info>

TLDR;

Ellipsis is a DevTool that converts technical instruction into working, tested code. [See it in action](https://ellipsis.dev/).



</Info>

You can use Ellipsis to:

*   [generate pull requests from issues](/code), such as feature requests and bug reports
*   [automate code reviews](/review)
*   [address comments on PRs](/code)
*   [ask questions about your codebase](/ask)
*   [create release notes/change summaries](/summary)

Because Ellipsis is installed in your GitHub/GitLab repository, the code generated by Ellipsis uses the the same libraries/frameworks, and paradigms found elsewhere in your codebase.

The generated code is tested, as long as you provide a [Dockerfile](/build).

Most importantly, Ellipsis works on servers in the cloud, not on your IDE.

If you use GitHub Copilot or copy/paste code into ChatGPT, you should _[try Ellipsis](https://app.ellipsis.dev)_.
