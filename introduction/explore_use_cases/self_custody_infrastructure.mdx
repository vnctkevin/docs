What is Self-Custody Infrastructure?

[](#what-is-self-custody-infrastructure)

Fireblocks Self-Custody Infrastructure is a secure and reliable way to store your digital assets. With our robust APIs and multi-layer security, MPC, and Intel SGX, you can be sure that your funds are safe and accessible instead of handling the security work yourself.

[Start developing on Fireblocks today](https://www.fireblocks.com/developer-sandbox-sign-up/?gl=1*19mlzew*_ga*MTY4ODc5Mjc3Ni%5B%E2%80%A6%5D_ga_D39L1D2ZX2*MTY4Nzg2MTQwOS4xNi4xLjE2ODc4Njc3OTMuMjcuMC4w).

Set up and store your funds through Fireblocks Self-Custody Infrastructure

[](#set-up-and-store-your-funds-through-fireblocks-self-custody-infrastructure)

Using our self-custody technology, you can harness your funds to hold them securely and safely:

*   **API Co-Signer:** Automate the approval and signing of transactions and maintain custody with our API Co-Signer.
*   **MPC technology:** With MPC, the corresponding private key shares are created and encrypted in isolated environments among multiple parties. To sign transactions, the key shares are used to perform multiple rounds of computation without ever being brought into the same environment. Because of this, MPC eliminates the single point of compromise of private key creation and signing.
*   **Secure Hardware Enclaves:** Self-custody your private keys in secure hardware enclaves to keep your keys safe from malicious software or unauthorized users.
*   **Key backups:** Get a backup copy of all your signing keys and have full control over your funds.
