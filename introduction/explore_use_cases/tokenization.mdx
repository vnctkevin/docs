What is Tokenization?

[](#what-is-tokenization)

The Fireblocks asset tokenization platform is a secure and compliant way to digitalize assets and build blockchain-based applications. Our REST API provides powerful capabilities for automating tasks like creating, redeeming, managing, and issuing tokens, such as stablecoins or security tokens.
