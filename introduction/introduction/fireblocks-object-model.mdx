  # Fireblocks Object Model

[Suggest Edits](/edit/object-model)

The Fireblocks platform can be viewed as consisting of the following components:

### [Fireblocks Workspace](#fireblocks-workspace)

Each unique instance of Fireblocks is called a _workspace_.

  
### [Vault accounts](#vault-accounts)

A Vault account is an easy way to separate and maintain security boundaries across assets.

Vault accounts store your asset wallets on the Fireblocks platform. Any user with the appropriate permissions can create a vault account since that is not a workspace action that requires approval.

The Vault structure for your application you're building on top of Fireblocks can either be 'Segregated' or 'Omnibus'.

#### [Segregated](#segregated)

With this vault structure, each user of your application is assigned individual vault accounts.

*   For example, you may have vault accounts labeled as **User #1, User #2, User #3, etc...** each of which maps to a user of the application you are building on top of Fireblocks.

#### [Omnibus](#omnibus)

With this vault structure, all users of your application are assigned one, or several, centralized vault accounts.

*   For example, you may have a single vault account labeled as **Omnibus**, where all of your user's funds and assets are swept for a single withdrawal.

  
### [Vault wallets](#vault-wallets)

Vault wallets are used to manage internal deposit addresses. Each vault wallet contains at least one deposit address for its asset type.

Each vault account can hold any number of assets supported by Fireblocks, including multiple deposit addresses for blockchains that support it, such as UTXO-based chains like BTC. Depending on the asset type, different wallets may support multiple address types or formats. Each vault wallet is assigned to a single digital asset supported by Fireblocks.

Your workspace contains multiple assets from different blockchains. You can use one of the existing assets or add a new asset to your workspace and use it as an vault wallet.

### [Exchange accounts](#exchange-accounts)

To transfer funds securely to/from exchanges, you'll need to integrate an exchange account by adding your API credentials for those exchanges.

  
### [Fiat accounts](#fiat-accounts)

To transfer fiat through one of our integrated fiat providers, you need to explicitly add your fiat provider's API credentials within your desired workspace fiat account.

  
### [Whitelisted wallets](#whitelisted-wallets)

Whitelisted wallets are an additional security measure to interact with various blockchain addresses. These can be named how you prefer and marked as either 'internal', 'external', or 'contract'.

*   **Internal wallet** - a deposit address existing inside your organization.
*   **External wallet** - a deposit address existing outside your organization.
*   **Contract wallet** - a deposit address of an on-chain smart contract.
    *   (Note: This only applies to smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains.)
