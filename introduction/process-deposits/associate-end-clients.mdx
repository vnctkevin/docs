  # Associate End Clients

# [Overview](#overview)

You may want to or be required to add end-client identification information to vault accounts and wallets. Depending on the purpose, you can use different endpoints and parameters to do this.

* * *

# [Internal or auditing identification purposes](#internal-or-auditing-identification-purposes)
## [Vault accounts](#vault-accounts)

When an end client owns (or will own) all the wallets and addresses inside a vault account, call one of the following endpoints:

*   [Create a new vault account](/reference/createvaultaccount) (for new vault accounts)
*   [Rename a vault account](/reference/put_vault-accounts-vaultaccountid) (for existing vault accounts)

Then, use the <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">name</code> parameter to enter their identification information (e.g., "Customer_12345_Vault"). This propagates the information to every transaction that uses that vault account.

<Warning>

## üöß

Please make sure to not pass any PII data!



</Warning>
## [Wallets](#wallets)

When an end client owns (or will own) only one or only a few wallets inside a vault account containing many other wallets, call one of the following endpoints:

*   [Create an internal wallet](/reference/createinternalwallet) (for new internal wallets)
*   [Create an external wallet](/reference/createexternalwallet) (for new external wallets)

Then, use the <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">name</code> parameter to enter their identification information (e.g., "Customer_12345_Wallet"). This propagates the information to every transaction that uses that wallet.

<Info>

## üìò

Note

Wallets cannot be renamed, so you must create new wallets for existing end client wallets.

</Info>
## [Deposit Addresses](#deposit-addresses)

When an end client owns (or will own) only one or only a few deposit addresses inside a wallet containing many other addresses, call one of the following endpoints:

*   [Create a new asset deposit address](/reference/createvaultaccountassetaddress) (for new deposit addresses)
*   [Update address description](/reference/updatevaultaccountassetaddress) (for existing deposit addresses)

Then, use the <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">description</code> parameter to enter their identification information (e.g., "Customer_12345_Address"). This propagates the information to every transaction that uses that deposit address.

Warning

The <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">customerRefId</code> parameter should be used <em>only</em> for this purpose, as AML providers use it to associate the owner of funds with transactions.
