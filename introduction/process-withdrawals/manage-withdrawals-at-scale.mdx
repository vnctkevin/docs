  # Manage Withdrawals at Scale

# [Overview](#overview)

When users deposit money into your Fireblocks wallets, they expect to access and withdraw their funds easily whenever they need them. Imagine needing your money but being unable to access it quickly - that’s the frustration you need to avoid. In any retail facing crypto business, the withdrawal process is one of the most critical and active functions. Users rely on it to move their funds swiftly and securely, whether they're making a purchase, sending money to a friend, or transferring assets to another account.

Given the high stakes and urgency surrounding withdrawals, designing an efficient and secure withdrawal flow plays a significant role in any retail facing blockchain based product.

Crafting a withdrawal process that prioritizes speed, security, and user friendliness can significantly enhance the overall user experience, making your platform the go to choice in the competitive crypto market.

# [Automate the Withdrawal Flow](#automate-the-withdrawal-flow)
### [Setup](#setup)

Automation is essential for ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted 24/7 withdrawal service in a crypto business. Relying on manual signing of transactions is not a scalable solution and introduces significant security risks. To address these challenges, implementing an automated [Fireblocks Co-Signer](/docs/deploy-api-co-signer) component is necessary. This approach guarantees continuous operation and enhances the overall security of the withdrawal process.

### [Highly Available Setup](#highly-available-setup)

One of the best practices for automation involves setting up a highly available system. This means implementing the Co-Signer in an active/active mode, which are systems that can take over from one another without downtime, ensuring that there is always a failover capability in place.

### [Co-Signer Logging and Monitoring](#co-signer-logging-and-monitoring)

Comprehensive monitoring and alert systems are also vital for maintaining a secure and reliable automated signing process. Setting up these systems allows you to track the status of transactions in real time and detect any anomalies that might indicate potential issues. Alerts should be configured to notify relevant personnel immediately in the event of stuck transactions or suspicious activities, enabling prompt intervention and resolution.

# [Implementing Multiple Withdrawal Wallets](#implementing-multiple-withdrawal-wallets)

Using multiple withdrawal vault account can alleviate the impact of stuck transactions and enable higher throughput. This approach involves distributing user withdrawal requests across several withdrawal vault accounts, reducing the risk of transaction queues.

The withdrawal requests should be executed from these withdrawal vault accounts in a “round robin” mechanism, which simply means a circular execution between these wallets.

## [Advantages](#advantages)

*   **Mitigates Impact of Stuck Transactions:** By spreading transactions across multiple wallets, the impact of a single stuck transaction is minimized.
*   **Enhances Transaction Throughput:** Multiple wallets can process transactions simultaneously, increasing overall throughput.

While using multiple withdrawal vault accounts offers several advantages, it also introduces operational complexity. Here are some considerations:

*   **Balance Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the balances of each wallet to ensure sufficient liquidity.
*   **Automated Refills:** Implement automated refill mechanisms to transfer funds between

Having multiple withdrawal wallets is beneficial not only for Ethereum, which uses the nonce mechanism leading to sequential transaction processing, but also for UTXO-based assets like Bitcoin.

In the UTXO model, an unconfirmed output from a previous transaction that has not yet been mined can be used as an input for a new transaction. This can result in two stuck transactions that depend on the confirmation of the first one.

Although mechanisms like [Replace By Fee (RBF)](/docs/boost-transactions-1#rbf-and-cpfp-in-fireblocks) or ["Child Pays For Parent" (CPFP)](/docs/boost-transactions-1#rbf-and-cpfp-in-fireblocks) exist to release stuck transactions, it is still not an ideal situation to encounter. Additionally, the Bitcoin protocol has a built in mechanism that simply rejects transactions using an unconfirmed output from a transaction that has more than 25 predecessors. This not only creates a queue of withdrawals but can also lead to actual withdrawal failures, which is way worse.

The number of withdrawal vault account required depends on your transaction volume. For most businesses, 3-4 vault account should suffice. However, larger operations may need more wallets to handle the load effectively.

# [UTXO Based Assets Transaction Batching](#utxo-based-assets-transaction-batching)

The flexibility of the UTXO model allows you to control transaction inputs and outputs to minimize fees. For example, a transaction with one input and multiple outputs is more cost-effective than multiple transactions with single inputs and outputs. This is because a single transaction will have a single set of metadata, reducing the overall transaction size compared to the total size of multiple transactions.

Instead of creating multiple transactions each with single inputs and potentially one output, you can create a single transaction with multiple destinations, translating to multiple outputs. As mentioned before, creating one transaction with multiple destinations reduces the transaction's metadata size, leading to lower fees.

However, this approach requires batching withdrawal requests, meaning you collect multiple user requests over a period (e.g., every X minutes) and process them in a single transaction.

Batching transactions has both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it allows for cost savings by consolidating multiple withdrawals into a single transaction, thereby reducing overall transaction fees. On the other hand, it may cause slight delays for users expecting immediate withdrawals.

The key is to find a balance that optimizes costs without significantly impacting the user experience, based on the volume of withdrawal transactions in your product.

Fireblocks supports creating a single transaction with multiple destinations for UTXO-based assets only. This can be accomplished using our <a target="_self" href="link">Create Transaction API endpoint</a> by passing the <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">destinations</code> array, which contains different <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">destination</code> objects within it.

Check out the Developer Guide for creating a UTXO transaction with multiple destinations [here](link-to-batch-utxo).

# [Working with One Time Addresses](#working-with-one-time-addresses)

By default, any outgoing transaction in Fireblocks can only be made to a whitelisted address approved by the Workspace's Admin Approval Quorum. For businesses looking to scale their withdrawal flows and eliminate manual processes, whitelisting addresses can become inconvenient and cumbersome.

To address this, Fireblocks introduced the One Time Address (OTA) feature. OTA allows Fireblocks customers to interact with non-whitelisted addresses, streamlining the withdrawal process.

Learn more about OTA and its security aspects in the following [guide](link-to-destination-addresses).

# [Idempotent Transactions](#idempotent-transactions)

In the context of RESTful APIs, idempotency refers to the property of an operation whereby multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. This means that making the same API call multiple times should not result in different outcomes. Idempotency is crucial for ensuring the reliability and consistency of operations, particularly in scenarios where network issues or client-side errors might lead to repeated requests.

Common issue with Non-Idempotent transactions is duplicate transactions - multiple requests can result in multiple identical transactions being processed. This is especially problematic for financial operations, such as withdrawals, where it can lead to sending users more funds than they actually have, causing significant financial discrepancies.

To mitigate this issue, Fireblocks provides a mechanism to ensure idempotency for transaction creation using the <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">externalTxId</code> parameter.

## [What is externalTxId?](#what-is-externaltxid)

The externalTxId parameter is a unique identifier provided by the client when creating a transaction via the Fireblocks API. This parameter ensures that repeated requests with the same externalTxId will not result in multiple transactions. Instead, the API will recognize the duplicate request and handle it appropriately, maintaining idempotency. This is particularly useful if you don’t receive a response or if an API call isn’t completed successfully.

When creating transactions, Fireblocks strongly recommends using the <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">externalTxId</code> parameter in the <a target="_self" href="link">Create Transaction API</a> call. This parameter ensures that the transaction is idempotent. If another transaction request is made with the same <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">externalTxId</code> value, it will be rejected with an HTTP 400 code and the following error message:

<CodeGroup>
```json
{
  "message": "External Tx ID Duplicate",
  "code": "1438"
}

```
</CodeGroup>

The main difference between the <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">Idempotency-Key</code> header, which can be provided for any PUT or POST request, and the <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">externalTxId</code> parameter is that the former is saved for only 24 hours. In contrast, the <button aria-label="Copy Code" class="rdmd-code-copy fa"></button><code class="rdmd-code lang- theme-light" data-lang="" name="" tabindex="0">externalTxId</code> is saved permanently on the Fireblocks side, and will return an error if the same value is used in a transaction created even after 24 hours from the first one.
