# [What is Wallet-as-a-Service?](#what-is-wallet-as-a-service)

Fireblocks Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) is an API-based solution that includes the most secure MPC wallets by design. Our APIs generate ECDSA and EdDSA signatures to sign any transaction. It enables anyone to create, manage, and secure wallets for any number of users without performing the security work themselves.
