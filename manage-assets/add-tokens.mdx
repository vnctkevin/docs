# [EVM Assets](#evm-assets)

Fireblocks supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) assets across all Fireblocks workspaces.

### [What standards are supported?](#what-standards-are-supported)

Originally defined for the Ethereum blockchain, the [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) token standard provides a standard interface to implement transferable tokens within smart contracts. ERC-20 is used on EVM blockchains such as Arbitrum C-Chain (ARC-20), Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20), Polygon (MRC-20), and all other EVM blockchain networks supported by Fireblocks.

Fireblocks also supports token formats that adhere to the ERC-20 standard, including ERC-1400 and ERC-1404. You can view a list of all the supported EVM blockchains when you add a new ERC-20 asset to a workspace.

### [How to add EVM tokens to a workspace?](#how-to-add-evm-tokens-to-a-workspace)

There are three ways to add EVM tokens to your workspace:

*   Via the Fireblocks Console - visit the [following guide](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/5601259928220-Adding-EVM-assets-to-a-workspace) to learn about adding EVM tokens via the console
*   Via the Fireblocks API - check out the [following developers guide](/reference/add-your-tokens) for adding EVM tokens to your workspace
*   Via Contract Calls - an opt-in feature that requires Fireblocks Support. Once enabled, ERC-20 assets transferred in a contract call you initiated are automatically added to the workspace that initiated the contract call. A notification in the Fireblocks Console lets you know when a new ERC-20 asset has been automatically added to your workspace.

# [Non EVM Assets](#non-evm-assets)

Fireblocks supports certain non-EVM assets across all Fireblocks workspaces.

### [What standards are supported?](#what-standards-are-supported-1)

You can list additional assets on these non-EVM blockchains:

*   Algorand (ASA)
*   Digital Bits (XDB)
*   Hedera (ERC-20)
*   NEAR (NEP141)
*   Ripple
*   Solana (SPL)
*   Stellar
*   Tezos (FA1.2, FA2)
*   TRON (TRC-20)

### [How to add non-EVM assets to a workspace?](#how-to-add-non-evm-assets-to-a-workspace)

Depending on the asset, you can add non-EVM assets to your workspace using one of these methods:

*   Via the Fireblocks Console - learn more [here](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/6641659764508-Adding-non-EVM-assets-to-a-workspace)
*   Via the Fireblocks API - check out the [following developers guide](/reference/add-your-tokens) for adding Non EVM tokens to your workpace
*   Via Fireblocks Support - Contact Fireblocks Support to add an unlisted asset on one of these blockchains to your workspace. You must provide a link to the token's page from the relevant block explorer:
    *   DigitalBits
    *   Hedera
    *   Ripple
    *   Tezos

Depending on the token requested, Fireblocks may make the token available to all Fireblocks customers or only to your workspaces.
