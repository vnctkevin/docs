# [Overview](#overview)

Tokenization is the representation of an asset, which could be a real-world physical asset or a digitally native one, on a distributed ledger. Tokens represent ownership, control, claim, or a right to the underlying asset or service. With Fireblocks, you can issue and manage tokens for your specific use case, such as stablecoins, carbon credits, in-game assets, concert tickets, real estate, memorabilia, artwork, NFTs, or any other asset you want to tokenize.

## 📘

Tokenization is a premium feature that requires an additional purchase. If you don’t have access to this feature, contact your Customer Success Manager to discuss having it enabled in your Fireblocks workspace.

The Tokenization feature allows you to deploy and manage tokenized assets and their lifecycle via the Fireblocks Console or the Fireblocks API.
