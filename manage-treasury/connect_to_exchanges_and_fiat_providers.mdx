  # Connect to Exchanges and FIAT Providers

[Suggest Edits](/edit/connect-to-exchanges-and-fiat-providers)

Fireblocks enables clients to connect their own (supported by Fireblocks) exchange and fiat accounts directly within the workspace.

Customers can bring their API credentials from the supported exchange or fiat account and integrate them into the Fireblocks workspace.  
Once connected, clients can seamlessly transfer funds to and from the connected exchange account via the Fireblocks console or the API.

  

Additionally, clients can view the balances of their connected exchange accounts and set Transaction Authorization Policies (TAP) and automated processes around these accounts, enhancing both control and efficiency in managing their assets.
