Overview

[](#overview)

You can stake to various networks from your Vault using the Fireblocks API. When staking, you select a third-party staking provider to operate the validators associated with your staked funds. Typically, the staked amount is locked for a certain period of time.

Staked assets become eligible to receive rewards after the network's activation period. Staking rewards are calculated over a period of time usually known as an epoch. This is the period of time in which validators and their staked amount are accounted for. Depending on the network, an epoch may be anywhere from a few minutes to several days. Typically, staking rewards are calculated and distributed after each epoch ends.

When you unstake your assets, you no longer generate staking rewards, but you're able to use those assets for other transactions.

Staking via Fireblocks API

[](#staking-via-fireblocks-api)

To stake, you must fund a vault account with the asset you want to stake and create Transaction Authorization Policy (TAP) rules for staking. Then create staking transactions using the dedicated [staking API endpoints](/reference/getchains).

Staking with the Fireblocks API allows you to:

*   Easily and securely stake assets through native API calls.
*   Create dedicated TAP rules for staking using the **Stake** operation type.
*   Track the status and rewards for your staked funds.
*   Initiate staking transactions without the need for SDKs, scripts, or Raw Signing.
*   Select validators to oversee your staked funds.
