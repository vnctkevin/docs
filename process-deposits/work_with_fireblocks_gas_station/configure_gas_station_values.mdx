# Configure Gas Station Values

[Suggest Edits](/edit/configure-gas-station-values)

You can configure the Fireblocks Gas Station with a gas threshold, a gas cap, and a maximum gas price for each blockchain network according to its base asset by using the Fireblocks API.

*   **Gas threshold (gasThreshold):** The gas threshold represents the minimum balance allowed in the Gas Station account. If the balance is below the minimum gas threshold, the Gas Station fuels the vault account automatically with the set maximum gas cap.
*   **Gas cap (gasCap):** The gas cap represents the maximum balance allowed in the Gas Station account.
*   **Maximum gas price (maxGasPrice):** The maximum gas price allows you to limit the maximum transaction fee for Gas Station transactions. The funding transaction will be sent in gwei with this maximum value gas price or less. A null value for the maximum gas price means the fee will be paid at any cost, without limitations. If you changed the maximum gas price settings and want to revert to the default settings of null, you can enter an empty string as `""`.

When an incoming token deposit or an outgoing token withdrawal is detected, the Gas Station checks the gas balance of the vault account. If the balance is below the minimum gas threshold, it automatically fuels the vault account with the set maximum gas cap.
