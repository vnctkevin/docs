Overview

[](#overview)

You may want to or be required to add end-client identification information to vault accounts and wallets. Depending on the purpose, you can use different endpoints and parameters to do this.

# 

Internal or auditing identification purposes

[](#internal-or-auditing-identification-purposes)

## 

Vault accounts

[](#vault-accounts)

When an end client owns (or will own) all the wallets and addresses inside a vault account, call one of the following endpoints:

*   [Create a new vault account](/reference/createvaultaccount) (for new vault accounts)
*   [Rename a vault account](/reference/put_vault-accounts-vaultaccountid) (for existing vault accounts)

Then, use the `name` parameter to enter their identification information (e.g., "Customer\_12345\_Vault"). This propagates the information to every transaction that uses that vault account.

<Warning>

## 🚧

Please make sure to not pass any PII data!



</Warning>

## 

Wallets

[](#wallets)

When an end client owns (or will own) only one or only a few wallets inside a vault account containing many other wallets, call one of the following endpoints:

*   [Create an internal wallet](/reference/createinternalwallet) (for new internal wallets)
*   [Create an external wallet](/reference/createexternalwallet) (for new external wallets)

Then, use the `name` parameter to enter their identification information (e.g., "Customer\_12345\_Wallet"). This propagates the information to every transaction that uses that wallet.

<Info>

## 📘

Note

Wallets cannot be renamed, so you must create new wallets for existing end client wallets.

## 

Deposit Addresses

[](#deposit-addresses)

When an end client owns (or will own) only one or only a few deposit addresses inside a wallet containing many other addresses, call one of the following endpoints:

*   [Create a new asset deposit address](/reference/createvaultaccountassetaddress) (for new deposit addresses)
*   [Update address description](/reference/updatevaultaccountassetaddress) (for existing deposit addresses)

Then, use the `description` parameter to enter their identification information (e.g., "Customer\_12345\_Address"). This propagates the information to every transaction that uses that deposit address.

* * *

AML/CFT identification purposes

[](#amlcft-identification-purposes)

<Warning>

## ❗️

Warning

The `customerRefId` parameter should be used _only_ for this purpose, as AML providers use it to associate the owner of funds with transactions.

</Warning>

## 

Vault accounts

[](#vault-accounts-1)

When an end client owns (or will own) all the wallets and addresses inside a vault account, call one of the following endpoints:

*   [Create a new vault account](/reference/createvaultaccount) (for new vault accounts)
*   [Set an AML/KYT customer reference ID for a vault account](/reference/setvaultaccountcustomerrefid) (for existing vault accounts)

Then, use the `customerRefId` parameter to enter their identification information (e.g., "Customer\_12345\_Vault"). This propagates the vault account's name, the wallet address, the asset name, and the end client’s information to every transaction that uses that vault account.

## 

Wallets

[](#wallets-1)

When an end client owns (or will own) only one or only a few wallets inside a vault account containing many other wallets, call one of the following endpoints:

*   [Create an internal wallet](/reference/createinternalwallet) (for new internal wallets)
*   [Create an external wallet](/reference/createexternalwallethttps://developers.fireblocks.com/reference/post_external-wallets) (for new external wallets)
*   [Set an AML/KYT customer reference ID for an internal wallet](/reference/setcustomerrefidforinternalwallet) (for existing internal wallets)
*   [Set an AML/KYT customer reference ID for an external wallet](/reference/setexternalwalletcustomerrefid) (for existing external wallets)

Then, use the `customerRefId` parameter to enter their identification information (e.g., "Customer\_12345\_Wallet"). This propagates the name of the vault account containing the wallet, the wallet address, the asset name, and the end client’s information to every transaction that uses that wallet.

## 

Deposit Addresses

[](#deposit-addresses-1)

When an end client owns (or will own) only one or only a few deposit addresses inside a wallet containing many other addresses, call one of the following endpoints:

*   [Create a new asset deposit address](/reference/createvaultaccountassetaddress) (for new deposit addresses)
*   [Assign AML customer reference ID](/reference/post_vault-accounts-vaultaccountid-assetid-addresses-addressid-set-customer-ref-id) (for existing deposit addresses)

Then, use the `customerRefId` parameter to enter their identification information (e.g., "Customer\_12345\_Address"). This propagates the name of the vault account containing the wallet, the wallet address, the description of the deposit address, the asset name, and the end client's information to every transaction that uses that deposit address.
