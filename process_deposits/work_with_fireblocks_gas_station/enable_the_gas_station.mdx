Gas Station 1.0

[](#gas-station-10)

  

[Contact Fireblocks Support to enable the Gas Station in your workspace](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360003372200). After they enable it, verify the following in your workspace:

1.  On the Network page, you should have a new Network Connection named **Fireblocks Gas Station**.
2.  On the Whitelisted Addresses page, you should have a new internal wallet called **Gas Station Wallet**. This internal wallet holds asset addresses reflecting EVM-based assets supported by the Gas Station that exist on each of the vaults you enable the Gas Station on.

Gas Station 2.0

[](#gas-station-20)

The Fireblocks Gas Station 2.0 now offers a self-service auto-fueling solution. You can designate a single vault account in your workspace as the auto-fuel Gas Station, and activate the auto-fueling option on other vault accounts. This allows for a self-managed, self-custody Gas Station service, and helps eliminate friction.
