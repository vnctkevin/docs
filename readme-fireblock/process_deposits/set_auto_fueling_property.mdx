Overview

[](#overview)

Vault account auto-fueling is always available for API users with the Gas Station enabled, and any vault account with the Gas Station badge in the Console participates in the Gas Station service.

*   When an incoming token transaction to an auto-fueling vault account completes, Fireblocks automatically transfers the appropriate base asset from the Gas Station to the vault account. This is because the auto-fueled vault account must have a token with a non-zero balance on the relevant network where you are expecting an auto-fueling transaction.
*   When an outgoing transaction from an auto-fueling vault account completes, Fireblocks checks the token and gas balance. The vault account is refueled if the token balance is above 0.00001 and the base asset is below the set threshold. Token transfers from this vault account to any destination will then have sufficient gas to cover transaction fees.

Enabling auto-fueling in the Console

[](#enabling-auto-fueling-in-the-console)

For new vault accounts, select **Auto-fuel with gas after an incoming transaction completes** when you create the account.

For existing vault accounts, go to **My Funds** > **Accounts**, find the appropriate vault account, and then select **More Actions** (**...**) > **Enable Auto-Fueling** > **Enable**. The Gas Station badge appears next to the name of the vault account when you're done.

# 

Disabling auto-fueling in the Console

[](#disabling-auto-fueling-in-the-console)

In the Fireblocks Console, go to **My Funds** > **Accounts**, find the appropriate vault account, and then select **More Actions** (**...**) > **Disable Auto-Fueling** > **Disable**. The Gas Station badge is removed when you're done.

Enabling auto-fueling via the API

[](#enabling-auto-fueling-via-the-api)

For new vault accounts, call the [Create a new vault account endpoint](/reference/post_vault-accounts) and set the **autoFuel** field to **true**.

For existing vault accounts:

1.  Call the [List vault accounts (paginated) endpoint](/reference/get_vault-accounts-paged) to find the vault account's ID.
2.  Call the [Turn auto-fueling on or off endpoint](/reference/post_vault-accounts-vaultaccountid-set-auto-fuel), enter the vault account's ID in the **vaultAccountId** field, and then set the **autoFuel** field to **true**.

Disabling auto-fueling via the API

[](#disabling-auto-fueling-via-the-api)

1.  Call the [List vault accounts (paginated) endpoint](/reference/get_vault-accounts-paged) to find the ID of the vault account.
2.  Call the [Turn auto-fueling on or off endpoint](/reference/post_vault-accounts-vaultaccountid-set-auto-fuel), enter the vault account's ID in the **vaultAccountId** field, and then set the **autoFuel** field to **false**.
