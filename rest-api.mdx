*   REST API

# REST API

For developers who want to build their own tools on top of Ellipsis, we expose a REST API that allows you to make requests on behalf of yourself, or your own customers (assuming you have an access token for the customer repo):

*   **codebase understanding/codebase chat**: ask natural language questions
*   **code generation**: create pull requests

The API is currently in closed beta. [Contact us](/contact) if you're interested in early access.
