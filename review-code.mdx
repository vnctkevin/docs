# Review code

<Info>

TLDR;

Ellipsis automatically reviews and summarizes Pull Requests.

Our code review AI can run and debug code, catching issues that traditional static code analysis tools can't.

Ellipsis will also add a summary to a pull request, meaning you don't have to spend time writing one yourself. If you upgrade to a paid plan, Ellipsis will update this summary on every commit. Otherwise, this'll run on the first commit in a pull request.

*   Ellipsis will automatically review any pull request that is published as or opened in the "ready to review" state.
*   You can customize the code review using a [config file](/config)
*   Ellipsis will automatically update the title of a pull request if the initial title is `...` (an ellipsis!), so feel free to be lazy.

## [Give Ellipsis Feedback‚Äã](#null)

Ellipsis can learn from your feedback in order to improve, simply add üëç/üëé emojis to rate review comments. You can also optionally reply in the thread to be specific (no need to tag Ellipsis) - but remember to give üëç/üëé too. Ellipsis will take this into account in all future reviews (on this PR and on others).

## [Hide previous reviews‚Äã](#null)

On long-running PRs, lots of reviews can accumulate and cause clutter. While you can individually click on reviews to `hide` them, you can also have Ellipsis do it in bulk. If you ask Ellipsis something like "hide your old comments", it'll hide all its previous reviews to give you a clean slate.

For other ways to reduce clutter, see [config options](/config).
