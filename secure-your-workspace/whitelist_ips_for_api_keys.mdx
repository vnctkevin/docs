  # Whitelist IPs for API Keys

[Suggest Edits](/edit/whitelist-ips-for-api-keys)

The IP allowlist (whitelist) enables you to restrict API calls to only accept specific IP addresses for each API key. Only allowing access to a select number of IP addresses can lower the chances of a security threat or malicious attack.

If you have workspace owner permissions, you can follow [these instructions](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405980040210-Whitelisting-API-IP-Addresses) on the Help Center to add IP addresses to the allowlist.

Alternatively, you can also submit a ticket to Fireblocks Support with the IP addresses of the machines running your API client(s) and their matching API key(s).
