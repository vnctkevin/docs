# Security & Privacy

<Info>

TLDR;

Ellipsis is SOC 2 Type 1 certified, and it never stores your code or uses your code for model training.



</Info>
### [General​](#null)

Ellipsis takes the security of your code very seriously.

Our services are hosted on AWS. The security model of AWS is extensively documented [here](https://aws.amazon.com/security).

Our LLM providers (OpenAI/Azure OpenAI) do not use data from API requests to train models. You can find their policies here: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy), [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy).

We use [PromptLayer](https://promptlayer.com) for logging LLM requests to allow our engineers to provide production support.

### [SOC 2 Type 1 Certification​](#null)

Ellipsis is SOC 2 Type 1 compliant.

For reference, [SOC 2](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2) is an industry standard for security compliance. It requires organizations to establish extensive security guidelines and policies, and obtain certification through a thorough third-party audit.

To request a copy of our report, please [contact us](/contact).

### [Opting out of logging​](#null)

If you want to opt out of **all** logging (internal and to PromptLayer), you can disable it in the `Settings` page of [app.ellipsis.dev](https://app.ellipsis.dev/), or add the following line to your `ellipsis.yaml` configuration:

```
version: 1.3  
settings:  
third\_party\_logging\_enabled: false
```

Note that this will restrict our ability to provide you support.

### [On-premise deployments​](#null)

[Contact us](/contact) if you are interested in deploying Ellipsis in your own AWS, GCP, or Azure account.

### [Code generation​](#null)

For code generation workflows with a Dockerfile, Ellipsis checks out your project on our servers in AWS, where code is automatically deleted when workflows are completed, and never persisted between workflows. Our servers run in a private VPC with security group rules that prevent unwanted access.
