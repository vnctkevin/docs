# Write code

<Info>

TLDR;

Ellipsis converts your instructions into working, tested code.



</Info>

Ellipsis can change multiple files, write hundreds of lines, and update it's implementation based on your feedback.

**Note**: We strongly suggest you provide a `Dockerfile` so Ellipsis can test the code that it writes. This'll allow Ellipsis to fix it's own mistakes. Learn more: [https://docs.ellipsis.dev/build](/build)

There are 3 ways to use Ellipsis for code generation:

## [From a PRâ€‹](#null)

To have Ellipsis address feedback on a pull request, simply leave a comment (or a review) tagging `@ellipsis-dev`. Once you see the ðŸ‘€, you'll know Ellipsis is working. ![img alt](https://docs.ellipsis.dev/assets/images/pr_address_comments-2c51b96f8a7676cb83e2cf40d9af5d80.png)

## [From an issueâ€‹](#null)

You can ask Ellipsis to implement an issue on Linear or GitHub. Simply leave a comment like "hey `@ellipsis-dev` can you implement this?" and wait for the response. Once you see the ðŸ‘€, you'll know Ellipsis is working.
